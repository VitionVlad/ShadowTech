# ShadowTech
simple game engine
currently renders only a single triangle, but on android you can alredy fly around that triangle!  
teset on mi 11 lite, with pixelos, android 13 tiramisu, works fine! 
but i will ad new features to this engine, main idea, is to port then this to pc, rewrite in c++. it uses opengl es 3.2, that is the last version i saw  
new render features! render to texture, texture mapping, shadow maps.
