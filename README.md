simple game engine
currently renders only a single triangle, but on android you can alredy fly around that triangle!  
teset on mi 11 lite, with pixelos, android 13 tiramisu, works fine!(rendering one single red triangle is quite simple)  
but i will ad new features to this engine, main idea, is to port then this to pc, rewrite in c++. it uses opengl es 3.2, that is the last version i saw  
new render features! render to texture, texture mapping, shadow maps and deffered rendering in plan!
